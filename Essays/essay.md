# *Policy Brief*: Advancing Digital Commons for Effective Policy Making #
---

### 1. Overview ### 
Digital commons—shared resources managed by communities based on agreed rules—are pivotal in shaping inclusive, innovative, and sustainable digital ecosystems [^1]. They encompass open-source software, community platforms, open data, and shared infrastructures, offering an alternative to corporate-dominated digital platforms, which often concentrate power and limit access.[^2] Governing digital commons involves collaborative and democratic management of resources, fostering transparency and mutual trust among the parties involved.[^3]

Digital commons have the potential to transform how societies and governments integrate technology into governance through Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), which should leverage open, scalable systems and address human development challenges.[^4]

This brief explores the role of digital commons in public policy categories, criteria underpinning successful implementation, regional dynamics and recommendations to strengthen these initiatives globally.

### 2. Digital Commons in Public Policy: Objectives ###
Public policies for digital commons focus on critical domains, emphasising transparency, collaboration, and inclusivity. A primary objective is promoting open data and open-source software usage, not only to enhance sovereignty and public values but also reduce dependency on proprietary systems. By integrating open-source solutions within public administrations — DPI — governments lower costs while building citizens' trust in institutions through increased accountability and adaptability.[^5] The idea is, as public institutions control protocols and norms to ensure interoperability, public-private partnerships deploy public services on top of these building blocks.[^6] 

Interoperability and open standards are also crucial. Initiatives like the Digital Public Goods Alliance demonstrate how cross-border interoperability ensures the seamless exchange of digital resources, fostering accessibility and scalability. Public investments in digital infrastructure and the involvement of citizens generate new commons which, in turn, spur innovation and strengthen community participation.[^7] 

Furthermore, public policies supporting digital commons stimulate the diffusion of knowledge and ideas and enhance science and research in a variety of fields, from education to sustainability.[^8] This has a particular impact in the Global South, where targeted policies help bridge the digital divide and address literacy gaps, empowering communities to contribute to and benefit from a more inclusive digital ecosystem.

### 3. Digital Commons in Public Policy: How can they be successful? ###
The success of digital commons depends on robust governmental and intergovernmental support. Cities like Barcelona, Helsinki and New York and countries like France and Germany have demonstrated the value of the public sector in fostering open-source alternatives to proprietary software. Leveraging pre-existent modular architecture, these initiatives save time and resources while enhancing public control and adaptability.[^9] Equally essential is collaborative governance. Community-driven governance models, supported by partnerships involving institutions, private entities and communities, ensure effective policy implementation.[^10]  Initiatives like _Decidim_ in Barcelona and _Nutriscore_ exemplify how small-scale, participatory projects can generate significant societal benefits.

Stable mechanisms for funding are a cornerstone of successful policies. Digital commons require long-term investment to ensure the sustainability of the project, and (supranational) governments can play a pivotal role by providing direct financial support and encouraging cooperative business models.[^11] 

Finally, legal foundations and scalability are critical for ensuring integration at the global level. Policies promoting and advocating for open standards and shared protocols, such as _GovStack_’s interoperable framework, demonstrate how scalable models amplify the reach and effectiveness of digital commons.[^12]

### 4. Regional Dynamics ###
Analysing data from the _Next Generation Internet database_[^13] and the _Roadmap of the Digital Public Goods Alliance_[^14], it is clear that a regional divide exist in terms of usage and development of digital commons. 

The 
**_European Union_**
leads global efforts with initiatives such as the Open source software strategy, Next Generation Internet and the recent European Digital infrastructure consoritums. These commitments highlight the Union's willingness to foster the development of digital commons for a full sovereign and transparent policy-making. The aim is to build an European Digital Common Future both at the supranational and the national level. Indeed, some Member States have implemented progressive policies to support open-source tools. Germany and France’s integration of digital commons into public sector workflows, respectively with _CoDE_ and _Action Plan for Free Software and Digital Commons_, exemplify how governments leverage these resources to enhance innovation and collaboration.[^15]

In the **_United States_**
, open data has been central to digital strategy since 2012. Programs like _data.gov_ and _NASA’s Open Science Initiative_ have increased governmental efficiency and knowledge sharing, strengthening the foundation of open government and expanding into other sectors, such as education. [^16]

In the 
**_Global South_**, 
digital commons initiative address predominantly the digital divide and technological sovereignty, to liberate entrepreneurs and the state from dependence on technologies owned by companies of the Global North.[^17] For example, Ethiopia’s _OpenG2P_, integrates open tools with national systems to deliver social benefits efficiently. Sierra Leone has also explored the potential of digital commons through ministerial open initiatives for sustainable development.[^18] Grassroots initiatives often complement these governmental efforts, ensuring context-specific solutions, like _OpenMRS_.[^19]

In 
**_Asia_**, 
Taiwan’s _g0v_ initiative stands out. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the community-driven platform rapidly developed tools like a mask rationing system, demonstrating the potential of digital commons to address urgent challenges effectively.[^20]

### 5. Recommendations and conclusion ###
Despite growing governmental awareness of the potential of digital commons, to advance their integration into public policy several steps are still necessary. Governments should draw inspiration from successful examples, embedding digital commons into broader democratic movements and establishing legislations that support their creation and protection.[^22] Stable funding mechanisms must be developed to sustain commons-based initiatives with public budgets. Additionally, fostering regional and international collaboration, like the one of the Digital Commons Policy Council, will enable the sharing of best practices and tools across borders.[^23] Indeed, the integration of digital commons into public policy is not merely a technological challenge; it is much more. By redefining the digital public sphere and challenging monopolistic control, digital commons empower communities and advance the collective good.[^24] 

Policymakers must act decisively to support this paradigm shift, ensuring that the digital commons give way to a more equitable and sustainable society.[^25]
